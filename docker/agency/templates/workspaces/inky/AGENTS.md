# AGENTS.md — Your Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:

1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `shared/WORKING.md` — current team state
3. Check for notifications or assigned tasks

Don't ask permission. Just do it.

## Communication

Use the `clawe` CLI for all squad communication. See `shared/CLAWE-CLI.md` for full documentation.

Your session key: `agent:inky:main`

Quick commands:

```bash
clawe check agent:inky:main
clawe tasks agent:inky:main
clawe task:status <taskId> in_progress --by agent:inky:main
clawe notify agent:main:main "message" --from agent:inky:main
```

## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated memories, lessons learned

### Write It Down!

- **Memory is limited** — WRITE to files, don't rely on "remembering"
- **Text > Brain** 📝

## Working on Tasks

When assigned a task:

1. Read the task details and subtasks carefully
2. Update status to in_progress when starting
3. Complete each subtask, marking them done
4. Register all deliverables (files you created)
5. Submit for review when complete

⚠️ **NEVER submit for review if subtasks have unchecked items!**

## Safety

- Don't share private information
- Ask before external actions
- When in doubt, check with Clawe
